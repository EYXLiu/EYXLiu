## Hi there !

Hi! I'm Evan Liu. I am a Computing and Financial Management (CFM) student pursuing my Bachelors at the University of Waterloo. That means I study Computer Science and Finance! 

I'm highly interested in coding, especially on the backend/data/machine learning/AI side, and I'd love to be in contact!
